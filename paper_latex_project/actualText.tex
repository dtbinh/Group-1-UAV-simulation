\section{Introduction}
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are gaining popularity in private as well as commercial sector. One often-mentioned use-case is the parcel delivery. In the near future, UAV might be used to deliver parcels to your doorstep. The logistics industry hopes for positive impacts on their costs and competitiveness. The deployment of a delivery concept is quite complex. To allow for early evaluation and reduce the number of required flight-testing, a simulation engine is required. This is why SIMULATIONNAME has been developed. It supports multiple depots and UAV as well as  simple change of path-planning algorithm. UAVs move in a 3D environment  The engine does not simulate the behaviour of the UAV in the aerial space itself but allows for evaluation of spatial distribution of depots or the suitability of a path-planning algorithm. It was developed considering the use of swarm algorithms in the delivery use-case and allow for inter-drone communication and autonomous organisation avoiding a central ground control.

\section{Related Work}
Literature on simulation engines for UAV delivery is still relatively scarce. Simulation engines that were developed concentrate rather on specific components or flight behaviour.
\cite{johnson.2001} developed a simulation engine for the behaviour of specific hardware components of a UAV. \cite{lu.2011} simulated the flight dynamic behaviour of a UAV using Matlab/Simulink. MultiUAV \cite{rasmussen.2003}, a very general simulation engine has been developed to simulate cooperative algorithms for finding targets. In 2005,  an agent-based simulation engine implementing a surveillance scenario has been developed \cite{jang.2005}. UAV try to find targets without prior knowledge of the targetsâ€™ locations. They implement UAVs as agents and also use the notion of obstacles and bases. The sensor concept is similar to the one used in this paper.

\section{Scenario}
NO CENTRAL ENTITY, optimizes
\\
Before embarking the software model, the delivery scenario shall be described.  Every UAV has a depot, in the engine called basestation, from which it receives items to be delivered. An item's destination is within the range of a Basestation which means that every Basestation has a limited range in the area. UAVs are assigned to one specific Basestation and only deliver items of it. After receiving an item, the UAV will begin flying to the specific destination. It scans the area and stores information on all fields it has seen en-route. If a UAV meets another one, they will exchange information on the already-explored parts of the area.\\
If a field on the route contains an obstacle, it will deviate from its route and try to find one around the obstacle. Obstacles can have different heights, thus UAV als\\
After delivering the item, it will fly back to the basestation to receive a new item. If the battery reaches a certain threshold, the UAV will fly to the nearest basestation (not neccessarily its home base) and recharge its battery. 
 UAVs are moving in a 3D environment which means that obstacles can have different heights.

\section{Description of the model}
Figure \ref{fig:architecture} represents the software architecture.

ARCHITECTURE GRAPHIC
\begin{enumerate}
	\item General Structure :  UI, UAV Simulator, MESA, Analysis, BaseStations (depots)
	\item BaseStation: In the real world, this is the depot of a logistics company. It assigns orders to UAVs and hands items over to them. Basestations are responsible for all items in a part of the map and for a subset of all drones. Also, they contain chargers for UAVs whose battery reached a low level. In the configuration, one can set how many basestations are supposed to be on the map by specifying the number of fields the basestation is responsible for (its delivery area). Basestations are located as close to the center of their area as possible, but only on obstacles (on buildings).
		\item An obstacle can be any static object that obstructs a UAV on its way flying to a point (such as trees, buildings etc). Obstacles can have different heights. The simulator will load the height information from a JPEG file with different colors for different heights. The height levels represent different height corridors that UAVs are allowed to fly in.
	\item The simulation is built upon the MESA modeling framework. The following 
	\item UI: GUI in Browser, config.ini: As per MESA standard, the User interface is realized using a web-server and a browser-based UI. The configuration is parsed from a configuration file,  config.ini. It configures the setup of the grid (altitude levels, pixel width/height), UAV settings such as battery life and the sensor range. The simulation also supports different runmodes, one for running unit-tests, one for ordinary run with the server and graphical user interface as well as running without GUI which improves performance as no rendering is required.

\subsection{MESA}
MESA \cite{masad.2015} is an open source agent-based modeling framework (ABM) developed specifically for the Python programming language.  Agents are objects that have rules and states that act accordingly on every step of the simulation \cite{axtell.2000}. ABM allows to capture the path of the simulation along with the solution and allows for analysing the dynamic history \cite{axtell.2000}. ABM also allows to dynamically pause and resume the simulation at any given step and analyse the current results.\\
MESA comes with implementations of important components, such as a grid for implementing a simple 2D environment, a web-browser-based UI, a data analysis tool and an agent scheduler. It allows for easy extension or modifications to develop specific simulation engines. \\
Our simulation uses all core components of MESA, such as the MultiGrid, the DataCollector, the scheduler (RandomActivation), agents and the server component \cite{masad.2015}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The MultiGrid is a 2D grid with fields that allow for more than one agent on one field. This is particularly important for our simulation as agents of different height are all stored in the same grid in the model.
	\item The DataCollector is used for collecting relevant quantitative data to support the evaluation of an algorithm.
	\item The scheduler activates the agents. An agent will only do an action if the scheduler activates it. We use the RandomActivation which means that in every step the agents are activated in a random order.
	\item The server renders the graphical user interfaces and renders changes on the model. It also allows for pausing and resuming the simulation or progress step-wise. 
\end{itemize} 
In order for MESA to meet our requirements, we made some modifications to MESA. 


\begin{itemize}
	\item Which components did we remove or modify and why?
	\item Reprogramming of rendering engine. How and why?
\end{itemize}


\subsection{GUI}
\begin{enumerate}

	\item No simulation of a ground control system! The software is built for simulating decentralized organization.
	\item The GUI is implemented using MESA's standard server with some changes to improve rendering
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{UAV}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item most important component, tried to make a realistic simulation of a UAVs components
	\item UAV do not communicate with a central entity such as a control server organizing the flight traffic. UAV communicate with each other if they are in sensor range and only rely on their own sensors.
	\item Perceived World contains all cells that the UAV knows already. It stores information on obstacles. To improve performance, this is realized using dictionaries, one for each height level, mapping coordinates to information whether there is an obstacle on that field or not. For performance reasons, we decided against using MESA's grid here as iterating it reduces performance significantly. This is especially true for the grid exchange where each UAV  would have to check every field on the grid for content.  A dictionary contains unique values and is easier to exchange.
	\item Components (make a drawing). No sensors for physical flight behavior
	\begin{itemize}
		\item FlightController: This component contains the path-finding/route-planning algoritm. It represents a navigation unit. Multiple algorithms could be implemented, compare section \ref{sec:algorithm} for an example. The algorithm can make use of the exchanged information on the grid provided by the \textit{CommunicationModule} component and thus supports swarm algorithms.
		\item Battery: The battery has a limited battery life that decreases on each step. When the battery reaches a certain threshold (configurable), the UAV will fly to the nearest depot to recharge.
		\item CargoBay: The cargoBay represents the UAV's storage unit which can contain exactly one item.
		\item CommunicationModule: If the sensor found another UAV in the sensor's radius, this component will communicate with the other UAV and exchange grid information. Exchange of information on previously-unknown terrain helps when a UAV has to deliver an item to a new area of the map. This allows for precomputing optimal routes before exploring the actual area.
		\item Sensor: Scanning the grid for obstacles and other agents. This component is the interface to the model
