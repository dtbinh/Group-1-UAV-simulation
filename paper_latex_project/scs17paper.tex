% AUTHOR: If you do not wish to use hyperlinks, then just comment
% out the hyperref usepackage commands below.

%% This version of the command is used if you use pdflatex. In this case you
%% cannot use ps or eps files for graphics, but pdf, jpeg, png etc are fine.

\usepackage[pdftex,colorlinks=true,urlcolor=blue,citecolor=black,anchorcolor=black,linkcolor=black]{hyperref}

%% The next versions of the hyperref command are used if you adopt the
%% outdated latex-dvips-ps2pdf route in generating your pdf file. In
%% this case you can use ps or eps files for graphics, but not pdf, jpeg, png etc.
%% However, the final pdf file should embed all fonts required which means that you have to use file
%% formats which can embed fonts. Please note that the final PDF file will not be generated on your computer!
%% If you are using WinEdt or PCTeX, then use the following. If you are using
%% Y&Y TeX then replace "dvips" with "dvipsone"

%% \usepackage[dvips,colorlinks=true,urlcolor=blue,citecolor=black,%
%% anchorcolor=black,linkcolor=black]{hyperref}

%% The use of the long citation format (e.g. "Brown and Edwards (1993)" rather than "[5]") and at the same
%% time using the hyperref package can lead to hard to trace bugs in case the citation is broken accross the
%% line (usually this will mark the entire paragraph as a hyperlink (clickable) which is easily noticeable and fixed
%% if using colorlinks, but not if the color is black -- as it is now). Worse yet, if a citation spans page boundary,
%% LaTeX compilation can fail, with an obscure error message. Since this depends a lot on the flow of the text
%% and wording, these bugs come and go and can be extremely hard for a beginner to trace. The error
%% message can look like this:
%%
%%    ! pdfTeX error (ext4): \pdfendlink ended up in different nesting level than \pdfstartlink.
%%    \AtBegShi@Output ...ipout \box \AtBeginShipoutBox 
%%    \fi \fi 
%%    l.174 
%%    ! ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!
%%
%% and can be universally fixed by putting an \mbox{} around the citation in question (in this case, at line 174)
%% and maybe adapting the wording a little bit to improve the paragraph typesetting, which is perhaps not
%% immediately obvious.

\section*{Abstract}
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are flexible, versatile, easily installed and are in hold of relatively small operating expenses. Because of these advantages, the number of different UAV deployment scenarios is growing rapidly. In this paper, we address UAV-based parcel delivery systems. Implementing and testing such delivery systems is a complex and challenging task. To facilitate validation in the early stage of development we build up a simulation engine. This simulation engine is based on a decentralized approach in controlling multiple UAV delivery in a 3D environment. The aim of the simulation engine is to test an evaluate the spatial distribution of depots of drones as well as the suitability of a path-planning algorithm for the delivery use-case.

\textbf{Keywords:} UAV simulation, agent-based modelling, Smart City, Swarm optimization
